                                    You know, sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that
                                    you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image
                                    you have about me through my self-description. Here it goes:

                                    I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. I call it Optimistic Joy.
                                    There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write;
                                    I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I love seeing the sunrise in
                                    the morning, I like gazing at the moon at night too. I love to listen to music, especially Christian rap
                                    and jazz, piano and celo instrumentals. I like to do thought experiments when I'm bored, especially in
                                    the middle of the night when I cannot sleep. I like rain, although I don't like to feel cold.
                                    I don't like to sleep early, I most likely will not sleep at night. I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people.
                                    I like my country’s peace. I like noise and buzz of cities, probably because of Takoradi. I like delicious
                                    food and comfortable cloths and shoes. I like good books and movies (action, sci-fi, drama, anime). And, I like to laugh.
